OUTPUT:

### User Story:
As a trader, I want an investment eligibility check feature that automatically verifies if I am allowed to invest in a specific asset based on my risk profile, jurisdiction, and account status, so that I can avoid failed transactions and comply with platform and regulatory requirements.

---

### Assessment Summary:
Well-Formed

---

### Issues Identified:
- Criteria for investment eligibility (risk profile, jurisdiction, account status) need to be explicitly defined.
- No details on user notification or guidance if ineligible.
- No mention of how often eligibility is re-evaluated (e.g., on every trade, periodically).

---

### Suggestions for Improvement:
- Clearly specify all eligibility criteria and their sources (e.g., regulatory lists, internal risk models).
- Define user experience for ineligible scenarios (e.g., error message, alternative suggestions).
- State when and how eligibility checks are triggered.
- Include audit/logging requirements for eligibility decisions.
