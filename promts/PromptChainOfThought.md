### Key Performance Metrics

| Metric                  | Description                                             | Why Prioritize?                                                                                        |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Throughput (TPS)**    | Number of transactions processed per second.            | Measures system capacity to handle load; critical for assessing if the system meets trading volume demands. |
| **Response Time / Latency** | Time taken to process key actions (order placement, quote retrieval). | Low latency is vital for trading decisions; slower responses can cause losses or missed opportunities. |
| **Error Rate**          | Percentage of failed or rejected transactions.          | Indicates reliability and correctness; financial platforms require low error rates for user trust.  |
| **CPU & Memory Usage**  | Resource consumption on servers during load.             | Helps identify bottlenecks or potential scalability issues under load.                               |
| **Database Performance**| Query execution times, lock contention rates, connection pools. | Trading platforms are DB-intensive; slow DB operations delay transactions and affect throughput.    |
| **Network Latency & Packet Loss** | Time/delay and loss in data transmission between client and server. | Critical since distributed trading systems require real-time synchronized data flow.                 |
| **System Uptime / Availability** | Percentage of operational time during load tests.                | Ensures system can maintain stable operations during peak loads and unexpected spikes.              |
| **Queue Lengths/Backlogs** | Length of messaging or processing queues generated under load.  | Indicates processing bottlenecks; large backlogs will increase latency and cause timeouts.           |
| **Concurrent Sessions** | Number of simultaneous active users or connections.      | Validates the platform’s ability to handle real-world concurrent access without degradation.         |
| **Trade Settlement Time** | End-to-end time from order submission to confirmation.   | Measures full processing workflow, important for user satisfaction and system correctness.           |

---

### Summary

Prioritize metrics that reflect **capacity (throughput), speed (latency), reliability (error rate/availability), and resource efficiency (CPU/memory/db)** because:

- Trading platforms require extremely fast and reliable execution.
- Performance degradation directly impacts user trust and financial outcomes.
- Identifying bottlenecks early enables proactive scaling and tuning.

By focusing on these metrics during load testing, you can ensure the trading platform performs well under real-world conditions and maintains competitive advantages.

## Output for Q2: 
**Considering the Platform Architecture and Workflows: Identifying High-Risk Testing Scenarios**

### Chain of Thought Reasoning and Answer

**Step 1: Analyze the platform architecture and key workflows**
The platform is a trading web application consisting of:
- **Backend APIs** hosted on cloud, built with Java Spring Boot running on Tomcat.
- **MySQL database** for persistent storage.
- **Frontend React components** that communicate via REST and WebSocket for real-time updates.  
  Key user workflows include secure login (with 2FA), CFD instrument search and market data retrieval, and Buy/Sell payment processing.

**Step 2: Identify critical components and their potential bottlenecks**
- **Authentication Service:** Handles login, 2FA, session and JWT token management; a choke point if overwhelmed.
- **CFD Search:** Complex queries on market data and instrument attributes; dependent on DB efficiency and caching.
- **Payment Processing:** Transactional and stateful, involving risk checks, funds validation, order placement — sensitive to failures, rollback scenarios, and database consistency.
- **WebSocket Connections:** Used for real-time market data and notifications; can face connection stability and throughput challenges under load.

**Step 3: Consider impact and frequency of workflows under load**
- Login will have bursts during market openings or announcements — critical to handle spikes without locking out users.
- CFD search is frequent and read-intensive, possibly generating heavy DB loads.
- Payment flows are less frequent but require transaction integrity and low latency for user trust.
- Real-time updates are continuous and must sustain connection quality at scale.

**Step 4: Derive high-risk scenarios requiring focused load testing**

| Scenario                                    | Risk Description                                               | Reasoning                                                                                         |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Peak simultaneous login and authentication attempts** | Risk of authentication service overload, session store saturation, or rate limiting issues. | Large user spikes can cause lockouts or degraded login performance affecting user experience.    |
| **2. Concurrent complex CFD searches with filtering**       | Risk of slow DB queries, cache misses, and backend API timeouts.| High search volume can cause performance bottlenecks impacting data freshness and query latency. |
| **3. High volume of concurrent Buy/Sell payment transactions** | Risk of transaction failures, DB contention, order processing delays. | Ensuring transactional integrity and responsiveness under heavy financial load is critical.      |
| **4. Simultaneous WebSocket connections for live market data streaming** | Risk of connection drops, message loss, or latency spikes.       | Real-time market data needs to remain stable and timely to avoid trader dissatisfaction.          |
| **5. Burst of failed payment or invalid operations**         | Risk of system degradation due to error handling overhead or retries. | Failures might cause cascading issues if error paths are inefficient or untested under load.     |

**Step 5: Additional considerations**
- Test data realism: User role distribution (LOW, MEDIUM, EXCELLENT) affects scenario load profiles.
- Gradual ramp-up across these scenarios helps isolate scaling bottlenecks.
- Monitor system resource metrics alongside business KPIs for thorough diagnostics.

---

### Summary
Based on platform components and workflows, **peak login**, **complex CFD search**, **high-concurrency payment processing**, and **mass WebSocket data streaming** are high-risk scenarios requiring focused load testing. These are derived from their criticality to user experience, potential backend bottlenecks, and sensitivity to performance degradation under increased load.

## Output for Q3: 
**Chain of Thought Reasoning and Answer**

**Step 1: Understanding the context and objectives**
To ensure that the www.markets.com platform can handle a 10x increase in user concurrency—from 1,000 to 10,000 simultaneous users—we need to validate system stability, performance, and scalability under gradually increasing load. The goal is to identify bottlenecks and prevent system failures before hitting peak load, while also ensuring acceptable user experience and SLA compliance.

**Step 2: Importance of gradual ramp-up**
Ramping up load slowly allows us to observe how performance metrics (response time, error rates, resource utilization) change as concurrency increases. This helps localize thresholds where degradation begins, instead of overwhelming the system abruptly and causing cascading failures, which provide less actionable insight.

**Step 3: Designing the ramp-up schedule**
A good approach is to define incremental steps, for example:
- Start at baseline (1,000 users), maintain for a defined soak period to establish stable benchmarks.
- Increase in increments (e.g., 2,000 → 4,000 → 6,000 → 8,000 → 10,000) with soak times at each stage.
- Each increment should last long enough to capture system steady-state behavior, including peak backend and DB load.

**Step 4: Monitoring key metrics throughout**
During ramp-up, continuously track:
- Response times for login, CFD search, and payment processing.
- Error rates and types (timeouts, failed transactions).
- System resource utilization (CPU, memory, DB latency).
- WebSocket connection stability.

**Step 5: Identifying and mitigating risks**

- **Risk 1: Abrupt system failure due to sudden overload.**  
  *Mitigation:* Gradual ramp avoids shocks; implement automated aborts if error rates spike.

- **Risk 2: Hidden resource leaks causing degradation at higher loads.**  
  *Mitigation:* Use soak tests and detailed monitoring to catch memory leaks, connection pool exhaustion.

- **Risk 3: Test environment not perfectly mirroring production.**  
  *Mitigation:* Validate environment parity before tests; consider impact of non-prod factors.

- **Risk 4: Data contention or bottlenecks at databases or message queues.**  
  *Mitigation:* Analyze DB query performance and backend logs after each ramp to tune indexes, queries, or scale DB nodes.

- **Risk 5: Rate limiting or throttling mechanisms triggered unexpectedly.**  
  *Mitigation:* Coordinate with development to understand system limits and configure test to avoid unintended throttling or log them deliberately.

**Step 6: Decision points and iteration**
If metrics degrade significantly at any stage, pause the ramp-up, perform root cause analysis, optimize, and retest smaller increments before proceeding. This iterative approach avoids wasting resources testing unrealistic loads.
