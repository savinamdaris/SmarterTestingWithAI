[attach the Context Project File into the prompt]
- **Step 1:** Develop core test cases for trade order submission and execution
- **Step 2:** Incorporate real-time market data updates and validate synchronization 
- **Step 3:** Expand testing scope to include security (authorization, data encryption) and regulatory compliance
- **Step 4:** Ensure trading features work seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
 
 

## Output: 

### Step 1: Develop Core Test Cases for Trade Order Submission and Execution
- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Validate order entry form accepts valid inputs (symbol, quantity, order type).
  - Confirm orders are successfully submitted and acknowledged by the platform.
  - Verify different order types (market, limit, stop-loss) execute correctly.
  - Check error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., negative quantity, unsupported symbols).
  - Confirm immediate reflection of executed trades in user portfolio and trade history.
- **Expected Outcomes:**
  - Accurate order processing with real-time feedback.
  - No data loss or duplication of orders.
  - Clear and actionable error messages on invalid operations.

### Step 2: Incorporate Real-Time Market Data Updates and Validate Synchronization
- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Verify live streaming of market prices updates the UI without delay or glitches.
  - Ensure order book and trade ticker reflect current market status synchronously across users.
  - Simulate delayed or lost market data events and verify system resilience and recovery.
  - Test UI consistency when rapid fluctuations occur (e.g., price spikes).
- **Expected Outcomes:**
  - Seamless real-time data updates with minimal latency.
  - No stale or inconsistent market data visible to users.
  - System handles interruptions gracefully, auto-refreshing once data resumes.

### Step 3: Expand Testing Scope to Include Security (Authorization, Data Encryption) and Regulatory Compliance
- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Verify role-based access controls restrict order submission and account management appropriately.
  - Confirm data transmitted between client and server is encrypted (TLS/SSL).
  - Validate session timeout and multi-factor authentication processes.
  - Check audit logs are generated for critical actions complying with financial regulations.
  - Test compliance with trading rules such as order limits and blackout periods.
- **Expected Outcomes:**
  - Unauthorized actions are blocked and logged.
  - Sensitive data protected in transit and at rest.
  - Platform meets applicable regulatory standards and auditability.

### Step 4: Ensure Trading Features Work Seamlessly Across Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile Devices
- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Validate UI responsiveness and usability on different screen sizes and resolutions.
  - Confirm feature parity and functional consistency across browsers and devices.
  - Test order submission and market data updates over cellular and Wi-Fi networks.
  - Verify touch interactions (tap, swipe) function as expected on mobile devices.
- **Expected Outcomes:**
  - Consistent user experience and operational reliability regardless of device.
  - No significant performance degradation on mobile or tablet platforms.
  - Users can trade effectively anytime, anywhere.
