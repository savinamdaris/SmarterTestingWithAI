## Task 4: Markdown Report ‚Äì Test Data Strategy & Benefits

### Test Data Strategy

- **Feature-based matrices** ensure all critical, edge, and negative scenarios are covered for each feature (e.g., registration, trading, withdrawal).
- **Cheat sheets** provide quick access to valid, invalid, and tricky values for common fields, supporting both manual and automated testing.
- **Persona-driven exploratory kits** enable realistic, scenario-based testing that mimics actual user behavior and edge cases.
- **Data diversity** (names, countries, currencies, instruments, roles) ensures coverage of localization, compliance, and business logic.

### How This Improves Testing

- **Reduces escaped defects** by proactively covering edge cases and negative flows.
- **Accelerates test creation** with reusable data sets and cheat sheets.
- **Improves automation** by providing ready-to-use, realistic data for scripts.
- **Enhances exploratory testing** with persona-driven scenarios that reflect real-world usage.
- **Supports compliance and security** by including regulatory, jurisdiction, and KYC/AML scenarios.
- **Facilitates communication** between QA, dev, and business teams with clear, structured test data documentation.

# AI-Generated Test Data for Manual Testing

---

## 1. Feature Test Data Matrix

- **Feature tested:** User Registration & Onboarding (including KYC) for Markets.com

- **Test cases summary (coverage achieved):**
  - 20 test cases covering positive registration, negative/validation errors, edge cases, compliance (KYC, jurisdiction, age), and special data (non-Latin, long names, rare countries).
  - Scenarios include: duplicate email, weak password, underage user, restricted jurisdiction, invalid/missing KYC, expired ID, mismatched KYC name, phone validation, and more.

- **Most valuable test scenarios identified:**
  - Registration from restricted jurisdiction (compliance enforcement)
  - Registration with expired or mismatched KYC documents (regulatory risk)
  - Registration with duplicate email or government ID (uniqueness constraint)
  - Registration with weak password (security policy)
  - Registration with valid but rare or edge-case data (robustness)

- **Table of the matrix (sample):**

| TC# | Scenario Description | Test Data | Expected Result | Priority |
|-----|---------------------|-----------|----------------|----------|
| 1 | Valid registration, UK, KYC docs, strong password | Name: Alice Johnson, Email: alice.j@email.com, Password: Qw!12345, DOB: 1993-09-12, Country: UK, KYC: Passport, Utility Bill | Registration and KYC succeed, user is verified | High |
| 5 | Registration from restricted jurisdiction | Name: Eva Smith, Email: eva.s@email.com, Password: Qw!12345, DOB: 1980-03-22, Country: US, KYC: Passport | Error: Jurisdiction not allowed | High |
| 8 | Registration with expired ID | Name: Henry Ford, Email: henry.f@email.com, Password: Qw!12345, DOB: 1975-12-12, Country: UK, KYC: Expired Passport | Error: KYC document expired | High |
| 13 | Registration with missing required fields | Name: (blank), Email: jane.d@email.com, Password: Qw!12345, DOB: 1991-09-09, Country: UK, KYC: Passport | Error: Name required | High |
| 15 | Registration with mismatched KYC name | Name: Paul Black, Email: paul.b@email.com, Password: Qw!12345, DOB: 1989-05-05, Country: UK, KYC: Passport (name: Peter Black) | Error: KYC name mismatch | High |

## 2. Test Data Cheat Sheet

- **Field types covered:** Email, phone, date, currency, password, username, account number, postal code, URL, instrument symbol.

- **Most useful test values discovered:**
  - Valid edge cases: one-character TLD emails, leap year dates, zero/large currency amounts, non-Latin names.
  - Invalids: missing @ in email, negative currency, expired card, blank fields, unsupported file types.
  - Tricky: reserved usernames, localhost URLs, rare country codes, very long names.

- **How this improves test efficiency:**
  - Provides instant access to a variety of valid, invalid, and tricky values for both manual and automated testing.
  - Reduces time spent inventing negative and edge-case data.
  - Ensures consistent, reusable data for regression and exploratory testing.
  - Helps uncover hidden bugs by systematically challenging field validation and business logic.

---

## 3. Exploratory Testing Data

- **Personas created:**
  - Alice Johnson (Beginner, LOW role): cautious, new to trading, limited features.
  - Brian Green (Intermediate, MEDIUM role): moderate trading, uses alerts and reports.
  - Clara White (Expert, EXCELLENT role): advanced analytics, automation, high-frequency trading.

- **Scenarios developed:**
  - Alice: KYC onboarding, restricted product trade, margin call, over-withdrawal, notification preferences.
  - Brian: Gold CFD trade, profile update, price alert, expired card deposit, tax report request.
  - Clara: Automated trading strategy, analytics dashboard, high-leverage trade, copy trading, mobile trading.

- **Insights gained from persona-based testing:**
  - Beginners are more likely to trigger onboarding and compliance errors.
  - Experts stress advanced features, analytics, and automation, revealing edge-case bugs.
  - Persona-driven scenarios expose gaps in error handling, user messaging, and cross-feature integration.
  - Realistic personas help validate business rules (e.g., role-based access, product eligibility).

---

## 4. Testing Insights

- **Potential bugs or issues identified:**
  - Weak validation for KYC and registration fields.
  - Insufficient error messaging for compliance and security failures.
  - Gaps in negative and edge-case coverage for phone, email, and document uploads.
  - Inconsistent handling of special characters and non-Latin input.
  - Fragile automation for UI changes and lack of negative API tests.

- **How AI-generated test data improved test coverage:**
  - Enabled rapid creation of comprehensive test suites with realistic and edge-case data.
  - Increased defect detection in early cycles by targeting high-risk and previously missed scenarios.
  - Supported both manual and automated testing with ready-to-use, diverse data sets.
  - Improved coverage of compliance, security, and localization requirements.

- **Challenges faced and solutions found:**
  - **Challenge:** Ensuring test data reflects real-world diversity and regulatory constraints.
    - **Solution:** Used AI to generate data for rare countries, edge-case names, and compliance scenarios.
  - **Challenge:** Maintaining data consistency across manual and automated tests.
    - **Solution:** Centralized cheat sheets and persona kits for all testers.
  - **Challenge:** Keeping up with UI changes and automation fragility.
    - **Solution:** Focused on robust data-driven tests and prioritized API-level automation for critical flows.
