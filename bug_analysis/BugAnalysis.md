### 3. Root Cause Pattern Detection

**Top 5 Recurring Root Cause Patterns:**
1. **Missing or incorrect business logic:** (e.g., 2FA not triggered, jurisdiction check missing, role-based analytics access)
   - *Prevention:* Add contract tests, strengthen business rule validation, review requirements.
2. **Integration/communication failures:** (e.g., KYC document recognition, notification delivery, audit logging)
   - *Prevention:* Add integration and end-to-end tests, improve error handling and monitoring.
3. **UI/UX update issues:** (e.g., dashboard not updating, slow dashboard)
   - *Prevention:* Add UI regression and performance tests, monitor real-time data flows.
4. **Mobile platform instability:** (e.g., app crash on order execution)
   - *Prevention:* Expand mobile device test coverage, automate crash reporting, stress test order flows.
5. **Data consistency and audit gaps:** (e.g., audit trail missing, withdrawal logic error)
   - *Prevention:* Add data integrity checks, enforce audit logging in workflows, review transaction handling.
