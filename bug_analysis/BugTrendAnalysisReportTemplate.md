...And consider the following:

5. AI-Driven Test Scope Generation from Historical Incidents
   Use case: Feed last year’s P1-P2 bugs and incidents into LLM to generate test ideas & automation scope.

🧠 Prompt: “Given these 20 incident reports, list test cases that would have caught the issues earlier.”

🛠️ Copilot generates Gherkin-style scenarios or code snippets for gaps in coverage.

🎯 Outcome: Concrete backlog of regression tests to build and automate first.

6. Test Prioritization Based on Live Incident Mapping
   Use case: Use LLM to match current test suite with last year’s incidents and identify test gaps.

🧠 Input: A list of test cases + past critical incident titles/descriptions.

🧠 Prompt: “Which test cases map to these incidents? Which incidents are not covered by any test?”

🎯 Outcome: Risk-based test gap report – immediate input for automation backlog.

7. Generate Risk Scores for Test Candidates
   Use case: Score features or modules for testing effort based on bug frequency, user impact, and change rate.

🧠 Use prompt chaining: “Here are bugs from module X. Based on recurrence and severity, rate its risk on a 1–5 scale.”

🛠️ Add Git history parsing with Copilot to include change rate.

🎯 Outcome: Focus testing and automation on highest-risk code paths.
