## ✅ Use Case 1: Bug Clustering & Categorization

**Prompt:**  
Group these bugs into clusters based on common root causes or symptoms. Label each cluster. Suggest a category for each bug (e.g., FE, BE, Data, Migration, Config, Other).

---

## ✅ Use Case 2: Severity & Impact Summarization

**Prompt:**  
For each bug, extract a short summary with: affected module, severity level, and root cause (if mentioned). Summarize how many bugs are in each severity level.

---

## ✅ Use Case 3: Root Cause Pattern Detection

**Prompt:**  
Identify the top 5 recurring root cause patterns in these bugs. Describe how they can be prevented or tested earlier.

---

## ✅ Use Case 4: Bug Density by Module

**Prompt:**  
Count how many bugs exist per module/component. Highlight the top 3 high-density areas.

---

## ✅ Use Case 5: Generate Automation Candidates Table

**Prompt:**  
Which bugs could have been caught by automated tests? List them in a table with columns: Bug ID, Title, Component, Type of Automation (UI/API/Unit), Suggested Test Case.

---

## ✅ Use Case 6: AI-Inferred Test Case Generation

**Prompt:**  
Based on these bug descriptions, generate high-level test cases (title + steps) that would have detected the issue earlier. Format as Markdown table.

---

## ✅ Use Case 7: Risk-Based Testing from Incidents *(Optional if incident reports are available)*

**Prompt:**  
These are major incidents from the last year. Suggest what test cases should be added to prevent these in the future. Identify any that lack test coverage.

---

## ✅ Use Case 8: Prioritization Score Generation

**Prompt:**  
Score each module from 1–5 based on bug volume, severity, and frequency. Recommend what areas should be tested and automated first.

...And consider the following:

1. Bug Clustering & Categorization
Use case: Group past bugs by similarity to identify recurring patterns and problem areas.

🧠 Prompt LLMs to process historical bug descriptions and group them by root cause, functionality, or severity.

🛠️ Copilot or LLM script: Parse CSV/JSON bug exports, embed descriptions using OpenAI embeddings, and group using K-means or cosine similarity.

🎯 Outcome: Identify fragile components with repeated failure modes (e.g., “Login timeout bugs cluster every 2 sprints”).

2. Severity & Impact Summarization
   Use case: Automate the extraction of critical metadata (e.g., severity, affected module, root cause) from historical bug reports.

🧠 LLM prompt: “Extract severity level, feature name, and component impacted from this bug ticket.”

🛠️ LLM + regex for bug triage summaries; ideal for unstructured reports from Jira/Azure DevOps.

🎯 Outcome: Enhanced data quality for analytics and smarter prioritization.

3. Root Cause Pattern Detection
   Use case: Analyze root causes over time to guide preventive testing and code hardening.

🧠 Feed bug descriptions and resolutions to an LLM, asking: “What’s the likely root cause category? (e.g., null reference, timing issue, auth logic, etc.)”

🛠️ Pair with Git blame + commit history for traceability.

🎯 Outcome: Highlight areas needing defensive programming or contract tests.

4. Bug Density Heatmaps by Code Area
   Use case: Map bugs to code modules and calculate historical defect density.

🛠️ Copilot-assisted script to map bug metadata to GitHub modules via commit history.

📊 Output JSON or CSV for heatmaps: module_name, bug_count, last_bug_date.

🎯 Outcome: Visual prioritization of modules for deeper testing.
