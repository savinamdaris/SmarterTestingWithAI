## 4. Test Cases to Create

Generated from past bugs/incidents:

- KYC: Test valid/invalid document uploads, edge cases for document types, and error handling.
- Dashboard: Test real-time updates after trades, UI refresh, and data consistency.
- Authentication: Test 2FA prompt for all roles, negative scenarios for bypass.
- Analytics: Test role-based access, data visibility, and permissions.
- Notification: Test alert triggers, delivery to all channels, and user preferences.
- Mobile: Test order execution on all supported devices, crash recovery.
- Funds: Test withdrawal for all account statuses, error handling for failed transactions.
- Performance: Test dashboard load times under peak and normal conditions.
- Compliance: Test registration from all supported and restricted jurisdictions.
- Audit: Test logging for all trade executions, data retention, and audit trail completeness.

### AI-Driven Test Scope & Risk Insights

- **Test Scope Generation:**  
  All critical and high-frequency bugs are strong candidates for automated regression tests, especially for authentication, KYC, dashboard, and mobile trading flows.

- **Test Prioritization:**  
  Focus immediate automation and exploratory testing on Dashboard, KYC, Authentication, Mobile, and Compliance modules due to high risk and business impact.

- **Risk Scoring:**  
  Modules with repeated or critical bugs (risk score 5) should be prioritized for both manual and automated regression, with additional contract and integration tests.
