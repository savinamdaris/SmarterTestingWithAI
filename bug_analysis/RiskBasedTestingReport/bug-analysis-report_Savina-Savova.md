### 4. Root Cause Pattern Detection

**Top 5 Recurring Root Cause Patterns:**
1. **Missing or incorrect business logic:** (e.g., 2FA not triggered, jurisdiction check missing, role-based analytics access)
    - *Prevention:* Add contract tests, strengthen business rule validation, review requirements.
2. **Integration/communication failures:** (e.g., KYC document recognition, notification delivery, audit logging)
    - *Prevention:* Add integration and end-to-end tests, improve error handling and monitoring.
3. **UI/UX update issues:** (e.g., dashboard not updating, slow dashboard)
    - *Prevention:* Add UI regression and performance tests, monitor real-time data flows.
4. **Mobile platform instability:** (e.g., app crash on order execution)
    - *Prevention:* Expand mobile device test coverage, automate crash reporting, stress test order flows.
5. **Data consistency and audit gaps:** (e.g., audit trail missing, withdrawal logic error)
    - *Prevention:* Add data integrity checks, enforce audit logging in workflows, review transaction handling.

### 10. AI-Driven Test Scope & Risk Insights

- **Test Scope Generation:**  
  All critical and high-frequency bugs are strong candidates for automated regression tests, especially for authentication, KYC, dashboard, and mobile trading flows.

- **Test Prioritization:**  
  Focus immediate automation and exploratory testing on Dashboard, KYC, Authentication, Mobile, and Compliance modules due to high risk and business impact.

- **Risk Scoring:**  
  Modules with repeated or critical bugs (risk score 5) should be prioritized for both manual and automated regression, with additional contract and integration tests.
